/*
What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows you to treat different derived objects through a common base
class pointer or reference, and call their overridden functions correctly at runtime.

‚úÖ Example: Using polymorphism with virtual functions
üéØ Goal:
We'll create a Shape base class and two derived classes: Rectangle and Triangle.
We'll store them in an array of Shape* and call Area() on each ‚Äî this only works
correctly because Area() is virtual.

We used a base class pointer (Shape*) to point to different derived types (Rectangle, Triangle)

We called Area() without knowing the exact type at compile time

Because Area() is declared virtual, the correct derived version was called at runtime

*/

/*
while you cannot instantiate an abstract class, you can declare pointers and references to it,
and that's exactly what enables polymorphism in C++.
Concept	Shown in code
Abstract class	Shape with virtual double Area() = 0;
Pointer to abstract class	Shape* shapePtr = &rect;
Reference to abstract class	Shape& shapeRef = rect;
Runtime dispatch	shapePtr->Area() calls Rectangle::Area()
Even though you can't do:

Shape s; // ‚ùå ERROR: abstract class
you can do:

Shape* s = new Rectangle(); // ‚úÖ OK
‚úÖ Summary

Can You Do This?	Example
‚ùå Shape s;	No ‚Äî Shape is abstract
‚úÖ Shape* s = new Rectangle();	Yes ‚Äî pointer to abstract class
‚úÖ Shape& s = rect;	Yes ‚Äî reference to abstract class
